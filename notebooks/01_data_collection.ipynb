      "Background: I've always had dark hair under my neck despite being blonde. I've always had monthly waxes with no issues, and the occasional ingrown but nothing memorable. I even shaved on occasion, if I was desperate - that'd give me a few bumps/ingrowns but they'd go away quickly and I'd be back to normal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last September, however, I wasn't able to book a wax appointment before a vacation, and so I decided to tweeze every single one of these hairs. With Tweezermans that were brand new and that I'd cleaned with hot water first. I got ingrowns on virtually *every* single hair, and every one of them left ugly red bumps that turned into scabs. Stupidly, I carried on tweezing because I figured that if the hair was gone, it wouldn't be an ingrown anymore, right? But I got more and more horrible red scabs, and they've scarred.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, I threw away my tweezers and let them heal and grow enough to go get waxed again. First time, fine. Virtually no ingrowns and it's all looking good. A month later I go back again and despite doing nothing differently, that time when they started to grow back, I get ingrown after ingrown after ingrown. It was the same waxist (who knew the back story), the same wax, the same aftercare products, and so on. \n",
      "\n",
      "I use a salicylic acid wash a couple of times a week. I use a lactic acid toner a couple of times a week. I don't tweeze or shave - I've been using a trimmer where I can to keep it bearable while everywhere heals. I use - at my waxist's recommendation - Sudocrem, every other day. This has probably been the best product. \n",

Undoubtedly, PR from L'Oreal will spin this as an attempt to bring the newer product size in line with other CeraVe SPF products which are of the same smaller size. I even bet the regular 89ml size will soon be phased out. Meanwhile, in Canada, the retail price (such as Shoppers Drug Mart) for the 89ml size has increased to $26.99. While the 59ml in size is slightly cheaper at present, I am certain that CeraVe will quickly raise its price to match that for the 89ml size once the larger size is phased out.

      "[Review] goodal Heartleaf Calming Moisture Sun Cream\n",
      "* How long I’ve used: I had been been using the goodal heartleaf sunscreen here and there for five months, but currently have used it almost daily for about a month. So total of 6 months.\n",
      "* Packaging: Nothing special. I’m not a fan of the twist cap, because sometimes I have to apply a lot of pressure to twist it off, which can make the sunscreen squirt out a little when the cap releases. Also, 1.7 ounces isn’t enough for one bottle, but selling small sunscreen bottles is so widespread with skincare companies that I’m used to it. I like the light green color of the bottle, and the recycled box it comes in looks nice.\n",
      "* Feel and smell: It’s super light. Lighter than the BoJ and Isntree sunscreens for reference. Not greasy at all. Very faint chemical/herbal smell, only detectable when I intentionally smell it.\n",
      "* Pros and cons: This sunscreen is mildly hydrating for my sensitive very dry skin, and does not irritate my eyes, even when I sweat. It’s easy to apply and I can just slap it on in the morning really quick. No pilling on top of moisturizer. No new or notable acne breakouts on my highly acne-prone skin, which is maybe the most important thing for me. \\[See attached photos for skin clarity comparison.\\] I also personally like that it doesn’t contain niacinamide, since my crazy skin doesn’t like any concentration of niacinamide. The tested SPF50+ and PA++++ ratings are also a huge plus. I’ve already mentioned the few cons, which are that it should contain more than 1.7 ounces, and that the packaging isn’t great.\n",
      "* Performance: I haven’t gotten tanned, burned, or freckled while using this sunscreen. But I also avoid direct sun exposure and I’m only 24, so I can’t completely see its effects on my skin on these month-long timescales. Honestly not sure if the heartleaf does anything to calm my skin but it doesn’t seem to hurt it.\n",
      "* Overall opinion: This is my HG sunscreen. Any zinc oxide sunscreen I’ve ever tried has made my skin insanely dry and red, while organic sunscreens with older filters piss off my skin and break me out. Also, many other modern organic sunscreens are non-irritating but break me out because of algae or niacinamide. This goodal heartleaf sunscreen is very gentle and non-drying thanks to its newer filters and alcohol- and fragrance-free formula. I can find it for around $10 on Stylevana when it’s on sale, which I think is pretty reasonable. I highly recommend this sunscreen to anyone at their wits’ end trying to finally find a sunscreen that works for them.\n",

      "Hi, i (M29) have had mild acne, located mostly on my forehead, for most of my life. I've been meaning to take care of it for years now. It just always seemed like such a pain in the ass to do. I dont really \"believe\" in \"skin-care\", so i haven't really tried it till now, but i'm willing to. I had a terrible case of blepharitis for 3 years in the past, it started a year after my ulcerative colitis did. I tried all kinds of treatments, nothing helped. Then i found a random redditor who recommended this probiotic. Zing, blepharitis gone forever. I used to wash my eyes 4 times a day, use an eye-massage device twice a day, and it hardly made a difference. I dont have to do anything at all anymore, just need to keep taking the probiotic.\n",

      "\n",
      "I guess that the most important thing to know about me is that I have an underlying \"rheumatoid factor\" causing rheumatoid arthritis.

I also have ulcerative colitis (started at 23) and it seems that these things and the condition of my skin are all interconnected.\n",

      "Now about my skin. It has always been oily, and dry at the same time. I've had dandruff since I was 12-13. I think I took accutane when I was 13, im not quite sure because it was my mom who forced me to take it. I would ask her but we are not speaking. The dryness has gotten worse over time, I'm 29 and I almost miss the oily skin i used to have, now I sometimes have dandruff even in my eyebrows..

Whats particularly frustrating is that she makes no effort to warn people that their products are tested on animals in these videos, but continues to claim she’s cruelty free and vegan in other videos on her channel, leading people to likely trust that the products are CF. She’s also gone after celebrities she’s reacted to skincare routines of when these celebrities have used non-CF products!

I stress little UNLESS ITS OVER MY SKIN! I drink spearmint tea and celery juice. I use panoxyl; salicylic acid, Adapalene gel, retinol, Paula’s BHA. NOTHING WORKS. I’ve tried skin cycling. I just can’t do it anymore. I hate looking at myself. I cant afford to see a dermatologist I don’t have health insurance yet. I’m just wondering if anyone knows any triggers I could be missing because I can’t do it anymore. I don’t know what could be causing it. It’s not even pustules either, if I spelled that right.

I used to have very bad acne until I went through an accutaine treatment. For a long time after my treatment, all I would do is use a sensitive skin non-comodegenic(might have botched that spelling sorry) moisturizer by Cere Ve. About a month ago, I started using a retinol called Differin gel. I have noticed that my cheeks and under my eyes get pretty red sometimes and my skin burns to the touch. I’ve heard that retinols can make your skin feel pretty dry at first, but is this normal? Am I doing permanent damage to my face? Is this retinol burn? I notice my face burns the most after I reapply my moisturizer. Any help answers would be appreciated\n",

      "             For about 2 years now I’ve had super oily skin and I’ve basically figured out that it’s caused by sugar. My skin is pretty much fine except whenever i eat added sugar, i get a cyst pimple on my face like clockwork. I’ve tried completely cutting out any added sugar from my diet and for the entirety of that time period i didn’t get any acne, then the moment i had some added sugar again, 2 days later like before, a new pimple. I wash my face twice a day, workout often, change my sheets a least once a week and all that accumulates in no other acne other then the acne i get from sugar. I really don’t want to cut it out completely again but it’s gotten to the point where i’m scared to eat bread because i think i’ll wake up in 3 days with another large pimple. Thc oil has an almost identical effect but that’s not as big of an issue since i don’t use it often but i thought i’d mention that too. If anyone has advice it would really be appreciated because i honestly don’t know what do do anymore.\n",

I have acne prone skin in my face and back and neck, while I have been keeping it at bay and haven’t had any active ones in a week about now, drying my face out with chlorine, and using sunscreen normally breaks me out. How should I go about applying moisturizer and sunscreen when swimming multiple times a day? I moisturize and sunscreen in the morning, but after I swim in the afternoon, how do I apply moisturizer again. Since the sunscreen will still be slightly on my face. Do I cleanse my face with Micellar water to get the sunscreen off then reapply everything multiple times a day? Or just apply moisturizer after splashing it with some water after I’m done in the pool? I don’t know what best to do to prevent breaking out. Any advice???\n",

      "**Depth:** (0.25mm-0.5mm). This is a feeling out process that will depend on my pain tolerance and baseline skin thickness, which will also vary based on the specific location of my face. At no point will I ever go over 1.0mm in order to minimize the risks of permanent damage, infection, etc. In general, I am using 0.25mm for every single section of my face (forehead, between eyebrows, temple areas, nose, under eyes at/below orbital bone, upper lip, chin, lower lip) other than my cheeks, which will be 0.5mm or higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Frequency:** 1x every 4 wks. I realize a lot of users may do this more frequently. However, there are a lot of posts and research discussing risks of chronic inflammation that gives the false appearance of skin improvement, but actually leads to long term permanent complications. Hence, I am airing on the side of caution and allowing for optimal skin recovery time.\n",

      "4. Put on disposable, sterile gloves\n",

      "6. In dominant hand, I will exclusively be handling the Dr. Pen. In my non-dominant hand, I will strictly be applying TO hyaluronic with the pipette and spreading across my face one section at a time. This will minimize cross contamination. If at any point I mistakenly break this contamination barrier, I am replacing both gloves and cleaning the pen and pipette handle with the alcohol wipes.\n",
      "7. Microneedling--> I will be doing no more than 10 passes in a single area. I am currently experimenting with going in circles vs in vertical/horizontal/diagonal lines. I am also using a lower speed (3 out of 6), but will likely adjust based on getting used to the needles and location on face. (I AM AVOIDING ANY AREAS WITH ACTIVE ISSUES: CUTS, PIMPLES, SKIN DAMAGE, ETC). I will only be microneedling in a given section until I see erythema (redness). My goal is to avoid pin-point bleeding as much as possible.\n",
      "8. Alternate with HA serum and microneedling, making sure areas of contact are always wet enough for the pen to be able to smoothly glide across my skin.\n",
      "9. After session, remove needle cartridge and place in cup full of lukewarm water with denture tablet for 30 minutes. Rinse off with hot water. Place in cup of 70% isopropyl alcohol for 10 minutes. Let air dry and store in original wrapper or plastic bag. Use 70% isopropyl wipes to clean pen and HA serum pipette handle.

      "[anti-aging] Are antioxidant serums worth the money?\n",
      "Hi! I am currently 29, don’t really have any wrinkles yet and just trying to maintain the skin I have. I use Cerave AM right now in my morning routine as my moisturizer and spf. I am planning on switching to either Neutrogena tinted mineral or eucerin age defense spf 50. My question is are antioxidant serums worth spending on to help stave off aging from free radical damage.  I would use this as my first step in my morning routine. My understanding is that vitamin c is very unstable and hard to formulate and the only one scientifically proven to work is the Skinceuticals which is ridic expensive and not affordable so I don’t want to invest in a vitamin c product not knowing if it’s working. Antioxidants in sunscreens don’t do anything because the sunscreen itself stops them from penetrating according to a Dr Dray video I watched. I was thinking of trying the Inkey List CoQ10 serum or their Bakuchiol so I wanted to know your thoughts. Would it make much of a difference using one vs just being diligent with sun protection? Have you noticed a difference when you used one vs not?  I am in a budget and want to try to keep my routine simple unless adding something works really bring a lot of benefit. \n",

      "in february i decided to start incorporating a retinol into my routine for texture and i've been using the cerave resurfacing retinol serum since february 20. but my acne's never been bad and i understand retinol causes purging but it's been about two months on it and i'm getting worried, as my skin has never looked this bad. i've had like the same patch of acne on my cheeks and some pimples that come and go. i never did peel or get dry though. i also had started on an oil cleanser to double cleanse and a sunscreen in the morning so i'm not sure if that could be the cause of it.\n",

      "hey everyone! i wanted to share my routine and some of my concerns to see if anyone had any ideas on what to add. i have extremely oily skin that's fairly sensitive, and my biggest concern right now is overall texture and redness. right now, i do the same minimal routine morning and night: i use youth to the people's kale/green tea cleanser, then apply the ordinary's niacinamide solution to my cheekbone/undereye area and nose (where i have the most redness). i use the roche pousay double repair matte moisturizer as well. this is literally all i do lol. i've just been struggling with uneven skin a lotttt so if anyone has any ideas for skin texture and redness it would be much appreciated. i'm also 20 if that helps :-)\n",

      "[misc] skincare burnout + spending guilt\n",
      "This might be a little ranty so apologies in advance aha. Does anyone else feel guilty spending money on skincare stemming from the trauma of literally nothing working. Like i'll spend hours picking something as simple as a moisturiser terrified that it will break me out or dry my skin. It doesn't help that I have the incredible combo of acne prone skin and eczema so no products are made for my skin type anyway. I always feel bad because none of my friends  have to spend this much on skincare. But that in of itself is oddly a privelege. Skin conditions are painful and uncomfortable to not treat it is just not feasible? Yet I still feel this deep sense of anger and disappointment whenever something doesn't work (prescription or not). I write this as i dread getting new moisturiser. I currently use the ElF holy hydration and it's alright but it can be overwhelming for my sensitive skin at times. But the thought of taking the plunge with an alternative terrifies me.\n",

I kept it for 10 minutes as it said (bad idea I should have started with 2 minutes) and I may have put some on a pimple which I kind of picked at (basically open wound). My pimple burns a little now and I can see some redness where I put the peel on. I used ceraVe moisturizing cream after.
