I broke up with my ex a year ago. It was the hardest thing i have ever had to do in my life, but it gave me a chance to focus on myself and grow as an individual this past year. I emailed him in December, and he emailed me back essentially saying it’s unfortunate how things ended up, but he still has a strong love for me. He’s been driving 4 hours in my direction every other week to see me, I’ve been driving in his direction on opposing weeks. He just keeps telling me he doesn’t know what he wants, he’s become dead inside since we broke up. He wants a family and wants a life but something holds him back and he can’t even figure his feelings out. He sleeps next to me, holds me, snuggles with me, he lets me kiss him and be affectionate with him… it’s only been 4 months since we started seeing each other again. I made his adoptive son an Easter basket, I’ve made him dinner multiple times, I’ve been sharing my life with him and including him in mine, idk if i should be more patient because I’m the one who walked away, or if i should just let him go? I asked him to tell me if he doesn’t see or want a future with me, because I’ll walk away if that’s the case, but he won’t say that either.

AskMen,"Hey guys, thought I would throw this to you as I would like a man’s perspective on the matter. 

Essentially I started dating this guy 2 months ago, when we met he said how he had a really bad past experience with his ex which was 3 months before I met him. They were together for 2.5 months it was a hectic situation, turbulent relationship, ex was emotionally abusive, cheated on him and manipulative, said she was on birth control and accidentally got pregnant. 

It obviously ended and he wanted nothing to do with her or the baby, wasn’t sure if it was his either. So they both blocked each other and went their separate ways. He found out last night she’s kept the baby and didn’t end up moving back home (we live in the same city but it’s huge) he was upfront and told me about it, obviously he was anxious about the situation but wanted to be honest. 

Basically am I an idiot for pursuing this man or tap out incase there’s a storm coming? I know this stuff happens and I do really like him and see it going somewhere but obviously as it’s relatively new between us (2 months) and I just don’t know if it’ll be worth it for me in the long run like I can see this being horrible for him and me as collateral damage though also it may not if she never contacts him again and he may cope with it okay. 

I’m not looking for judgement about his lack of responsibility in the pregnancy, if I was him and was with someone like that I would do the same thing.","Men of Reddit, if your ex was pregnant with your child you didn’t want could you really be in another relationship successfully?"

AskMen,"Sup boys, was hoping to get your advice on something. Earlier this week while on my way out of class, I (27M) asked a cute girl (mid 20sF), who I'd been chatting with a little bit casually over the course of the semester and crushing on, if she wanted to grab coffee sometime. She said yes. Great!

But then my heart pretty much stopped and I could barely remember the rest of the conversation. I kind of froze up. I remember she was like ""so when were you thinking, since have finals soon?"" and I said something along the lines of ""oh, nothing specific in mind, just sometime this week or next."" I didn't think this one out very far ahead, it was pretty spur of the moment. Anyway, she was like OK well just message me on Instagram (and gives me her Instagram). Later that night she accepts my follow and adds me back.

This was 3 days ago. Now the weekend is coming up and I'm not sure what to do. No further contact, and I haven't messaged her yet. Also, the semester is ending a few weeks so I kind of have to move quickly I think if I want this to be a thing. Coffee is pretty casual, and she's graduating at the end of the term and will probably head back home not long after that.

Anyway, let me hear your thoughts. When/how should I message her? There's a hip new coffee place near our neighborhood that I could take her to, so I was thinking I'd ask if she'd been there yet. But, idk, I'm having trouble for some reason deciding how (and when) to open the conversation.",Asked a girl out to coffee. She said yes. Now what?

AskMen,"Hi everyone, so I (23M) got into a relationship with a girl(21F) about a month ago and now I’ve noticed that I’m  becoming way too needy and desperate for her attention. I don’t know if it got to the level that she noticed it, but I can’t stop thinking or waiting for her to text me or give me any kind of attention, doesn’t matter physical or social media. 

I keep checking my phone to see if she messaged me back already, even if I won’t text her back instantly afterwards. When we are together, everything i say or do is thought of before, I just can’t chill and enjoy the time. I feel shitty about myself, I feel like I’m selling my soul to get attention from a f*cking girl. I kinda get what is going on but I don’t know how to prevent this from happening. She’s really a great girl (I’ve known her for a long time before) and I’m scared that I will f*ck this up myself by being too desperate and clingy. For some reason I have a feeling that she is getting comfortable and can already smell my desperation lol.

I have my own personal life - friends, job, just got into my first boxing class (which was amazing btw), but I can’t simply stop thinking of her and wondering if she’s thinking of me. But not in a lovers way, more in a “I wonder if she even cares about me way”.

Another thing I’ve noticed is that i stopped wanting to engage in activities with other people such as family or friends, if It’s not with her, id rather be alone at home.

Getting in a relationship made me so much more anxious. I understand that I’m not emotionally healthy. Please help me get stronger. Any books / meditation?

Context: 
So Me (F19)and my boyfriend (18)have been together 3.5years. We really love each other and try to workout our issues. 
But when we had been together for about 7 months one time me and my friend Rachel were in a call playing among us. Rachel kept telling me that Mike kept calling her( mike is my ex and also her best friend as they have known each other since 3rd grade) she then asked me if she could add him to the call and even though I was uncomfortable with it, I told her yes. She added him to the call and we played Among Us, I don’t remember talking after that and if I did it was saying hi, I was extremely uncomfortable and left after a few minutes of playing. I called my boyfriend and told him what happened. He was extremely upset and we fought, but eventually we moved on. This was in 2020. Fast forward to today 2023, my bf and I were in his car talking and since he’s planning on joining the military I told him, he better not cheat as I’ve heard many military men cheat. He told me he would never, but I’m hypocrite for saying this as I’ve cheated before on him(the situation with Rachel and mike above).
I feel that I did not, yes I made a mistake but I did not cheat and he says I did. he keeps saying I cheated but we can move on as long as I’m mature enough to admit the truth that I cheated on him, but I know I didn’t. 
He convinced me to say I did cheat by saying I knew I was wrong but still did it(situation with Rachel and mike). 
Also to add last year 2022 around July my bf went to Vegas with his family.My friend Rachel came over and was venting to me about mike as they had kinda started dating and she was telling me about issues and sexual relationships they had, I then told my bf what she told me and he broke up with me and his reasoning was that I shouldn’t have let my friends Rachel disrespect our relationship by talking about my ex who she was now dating. We got back together 2 days later and have been together since then. 

We are arguing over this and he is dead set on the idea that I cheated? What should I do? And what should I say to him to make resolve this?

So A friend of mine has a stalker. She has a family. But unfortunately, she cheated with someone from the workplace for about 6 months or so. This person is not married. She 'broke up' with him about 6 months ago, but he kept appearing and disappearing, harassing my friend. She told him that she's done with him, but he kept threatening that he's gonna tell her husband about their relationship in the past (screenshot of their chats at the time) if he can't be with her. Recently he started harassing her more, calling her when she's at home with her family, getting angry when she doesn't reply or answer his calls.

For background (from what i hear from my friend), this guy has a bad temper, frequents the local bar with bad tempered people. He said he once paid someone to bring someone's ear for him (i don't know if he's bluffing or not).

Fast forward 3 years later, we’re both single and reconnected via social media and the rest is history. Now we’ve been dating for 2 years and change. The spark is still strong, it feels unearthly and surreal. Sometimes I feel him come home before he even opens the door, it’s just how strong our connection is.

Although I do not carry myself as the slutty, easy type of girl, but when it comes to someone I’m extremely attracted to (which RARELY HAPPENS by the way but when it DOES) I tend to be more sexual and flirty than I should, and this as a result gives them the impression that I’m some sort of slut, and then when I want to find out where the situation is going it suddenly gets brought up that they aren’t looking for anything serious, that they just got out of a relationship and aren’t ready for anything other than something casual, that their car broke down and now they’re terrified of commitment, you name it. 

I don’t know why but I see no need to hide that you like someone when you like them, but at the same time it hasn’t been working out that great for me because I’m terrible at hiding my true feelings towards people I like.. And I feel like unless I figure out certain boundaries or a certain way to talk and act, I will never be able to be in a serious relationship or be considered worthy of anything more than one night stands or flings. Any advice? 😔",How can I (22F) carry myself around men to be seen as girlfriend material?

AskMen,"I went to Vegas for a work conference a few years ago. It was me and a coworker, and his girlfriend of several years tagged along. He was going to propose on the trip and they had already been planning the wedding.


We were at one of the social events in the evening, and his girlfriend couldn't join us; it was strictly for conference attendees. I gave my coworker my complimentary drink ticket since I don't drink. He got two drinks pretty close together, and said they were strong. He doesn't drink very often, so just those two drinks got him drunk enough to order a few more drinks, and he got hammered. 


He ended up talking to a sales rep that was also attending the conference and they ended up going up to her hotel room and had sex. The only reason I know this is because the sales rep asked me for his phone number the next day, saying they had a *wild night* together last night and gave some additional details. 


My coworker ends up not proposing to his girlfriend. It's been about five years, and they are still together, but not married. I'm pretty sure she knows that *something* happened in Vegas but doesn't know what.","Men of Reddit, what happened in Vegas that didn't stay in Vegas?"

AskMen,"
She is coming to my university next year (she had to defer due to not getting good enough A-level grades), but is quite well-known among our year group - so I invited her over to stay in my room for a couple of days and meet a few of her friends while she's here. We'd hardly spoken before that, but she accepted my offer pretty quickly. At this point, I just liked her and wanted to meet up. I am blessed with a sofa in my accommodation which I offered to her to sleep on, and definitely did not plan to make moves.

Well - I met her and quickly got a tiny bit obsessed... It's happened to us all. We chatted a lot through the day, and I started to really like her.

We ended up going to a bar with some of her friends.
To my surprise, something clicked, and we then went back and did the deed. A couple of awkward moments in the night, we had had some drinks after all, but both of us definitely enjoyed it - and we remained comfortable touching/kissing in the morning. I do genuinely believe she would have liked to do that again, and I'm normally a little insecure about my sexual performance.

I then hardly saw her for most of that day because she was seeing friends (as I say, she's a popular girl around here) and then she had to leave in the evening because of an exam the day after.

Here is the problem: now, both of us have enough exam work to do that it ensures we can't meet uptill they're done in a couple of months. The more we talk, the less time we each have for study - and besides that, I'm wary of the fact that she might not want to form any serious attachment to someone here before she knows she has a place at this university.

4 days later, we're currently at a text each per day.
I don't want her to think it was something one-off, I want to tell her how I care about her and need her in my life - but also I'm scared of doing so at an uncertain time like this. Not to mention the fact that she may just not be interested in me in that way - I can't tell after only having known her in person for a total of about 24 hours.

This is not a passing fancy and I really don't want to mess it up. What do I do if I want a relationship with her in the future?
Thanks for any advice!

TLDR: I can't see a girl I slept with once for the next 2 months and can't message her much because she has exams. I'm infatuated - what's my best way to get into a relationship with her in the future?",How do I keep hold of my crush who I've already slept with?

Why am I asking - First off, I'm gay, but just looking at me you likely wouldn't guess it. I'm pretty modest, no pierced ear or anything, I just look like a guy. I'm also not the type to approach a random guy and hit on him, and I assume strangers are straight if I don't see any indication otherwise.

When I'm working out and I notice a good looking guy, I find myself avoiding eye contact at all costs. I do my best to try not to look at him for too long. But I never really considered what exactly I'm afraid of until now.

Maybe if he notices me admiring him he'll think it's weird. Maybe he'll wonder why. Maybe it will bother him. Do straight guys get offended when guys check them out? Do they take it as a compliment? If a guy seems to be staring at you often, do you  possibly confront him about it? Do you even care at all?

It would ease me to know how guys actually feel about this. Perhaps it's a non-issue and I should just look all I want and not worry about what they think or how they'll react? Curious to hear your thoughts, fellas!","If you catch a guy looking at you in the gym, what do you think?"

AskMen,"**TRIGGER WARNING: mentions of SA**
Believe it or not, this conversation started over a meme I shared online. It’s the interview of Carrie Fisher saying “I don’t see men as people.” I have also been known to say “men are trash.”
My brother responded asking if I see my dad as a person. 
I just responded “if he’s not a bigot then he can be a person.”
He equated labeling someone as a bigot to be racist or sexist. Not even close, bud. 
Misandry is not the same as racism or misogyny. A man does not lose anything for simply being a man. 
White men are the largest perpetrators of violence, and by a wide margin. I explained that my use of “men are trash”
is directed at those men. If you’re not violent, it’s not about you.
Of course this becomes an emotional trigger. I am a victim of SA, all done by cis men. I was drugged at a party, his friend locked the door and watched. I was threatened with a firearm and forcibly assaulted, his roommate, a cop, was in the next room. There was a time where I was not afraid of men. But then I was SA’d. I have nightmares. I can’t be in the same room as a man drinking. I fear men I don’t know, and even men I do know. 
My brother’s only response was that “men are trash” is divisive. But on my end, every non-man I know has been traumatized by a cis man at least once in their lives. 
Why is the concern over hurt feelings, and not over men proving themselves to be dangerous? 
I have a boyfriend of nearly 3 years. He understands the sentiment behind “men are trash” and knows it does not apply to him.

I am 24F working security but since I was like one of 5 women who work here, I was delegated to work the lobby at the company I work for (instead of patrol). I specifically work in the lobby of a building full of engineers and while there are quite a few women who work here, there's a massive number of guys too. Though my position is similar to reception, I'm NOT a receptionist. I am not even expected to be nice, but since that's my personality and I'm used to customer service, I smile and greet everyone. I create temp badges for people who forget theirs and I make sure everyone badges in the door (no tailgating). 

There's quite a number of dudes chatting with me that get more personal than I'd like but I just do my best to be polite and end the conversation (nothing open ended and just saying yes or no) but I think these guys are taking it as a sign that I want to keep talking. If I get the sense they won't stop, I'll just say ""sorry I need to get back to work"" but then they still come back and talk anyway either later that day or the next morning. 

Anyways, I'm stuck as to what my options are as I am not in a position to rudely tell them off or tell them I don't want to talk. Is there was a way to tell these guys I just want to be left alone? Or maybe I'm just being too harsh. I just get uncomfortable when a guy is clearly trying to get closer.

Problem is, I don’t remember anything from the nightclub other than having to puke several times and after that having to help security get my one friend into a wheelchair because he had blacked out. 

I know what you’re thinking. Man, you guys must be light weights and can’t hold your booze. 

I assure you all, that this wasn’t my first rodeo. At 41, I’ve done and seen it all. I’m definitely no stranger to the club scene. 

So there’s about a 3 hour window in which I don’t remember anything. I couldn’t tell you what music was played, if I danced, if I spoke to anyone. Nothing. 

What are the odds that my one friend and I had our drinks tampered with?","Men of Reddit, have you ever suspected your drinks were spiked when out partying?"

AskMen,"I (F52) have found out the wife who is mine and my husbands friend has hit her husband many times in the past. She is 48, and he is 50. They have 4 boys at home, and the oldest is 21. The youngest is 12. She is a stay at home mom, and he is a family doctor. He is 6'2 and a big guy. She is 5'4 and solid for her size. If that is revelant. She definitely has anger issues that we have seen over the few years we have known the family. She is quick to anger. He is the opposite. We are neighbors in a country area. I went over to their home one late morning. Did my knock, hello, and enter.  That's very typical. I knew they had company as well and walked in. I could hear her yelling at her little guy who was 11 at the time and hitting him with a broom. Not the handle side but the bristle side. My husband and I have heard other stories from their 18 year old. Some folks might say it's tough love others might say the boys upbringing was abusive. 

We just found out that she multiple times hit her husband too, which answers questions I've had.

AskMen,"Hi fellas,
I'm 29 and back in February left my abusive ex of 9 years.
The first 4-5 years of the relationship was mostly great albeit a few issues in hindsight.
The emotional abuse started slow, comments on my looks, efforts around the house, comments on the way I would perform tasks, calling me less of a man. Then in the last couple of years it ramped up.
She would spend hours 1-on-1 with a male work colleague at our date spots that I couldn't get her to want to stay out for more than one drink at. I'd raised how that made me feel only to be told I'm toxic and suffocating for having feelings about that. She'd hit me and throw things at me in fits of rage and say the nastiest things because of how I made her feel...
I'd be excluded from social events with her colleagues where typically they'd love for me to be invited out. That kind of deal.
Eventually I left when I demanded respect and she still put herself first.

Anyway I've been attending counselling and have learned a whole lot of how I've been gaslit and manipulated and that a lot of what I was asking for was simple respect and boundaries desired in most relationships. 

The problem is the agony of loving her and wanting her back now that I'm mostly out of the anger stage of the grief. When I look online for support and stories around this I only find stories of women being violently abused by men. I'm hoping to find some support in situations that were similar to mine because frankly I feel isolated in this and would find some solace in relating to some men out there.

We have talked since then but I she told me she wasn’t interested in a relationship. I eventually just had to tell her that I can’t keep talking to her if we’re not actually talking.

It’s been 3 months since we’ve last talked and I’m genuinely exhausted thinking about her. I’ve accepted the fact that we’re not going to be a thing, and I have started to go the the gym etc. But I still think about her literally all the time. 

I’m a quiet guy, and haven’t texted or talked to any girls since. Every time I see her or even her friends in the halls at school, my stomach just sinks. I still have this idea, which I know isn’t true, that she was “perfect” and nobody is as good as her. 

I feel a kind of anger inside me, as if I have to prove her wrong, but I don’t want to live like that. I know she’s talking to other guys and probably doesn’t think about me, which makes me feel like shit even more cos I’m still thinking about her all the time.

So is there anyone here that was in a similar situation/ whose body hair really started growing in their mid-20s? I always kinda had a baby face and basically gave up on ever having a full beard but now kinda hope for the growth to continue and maybe have a full beard with 30 or something.

I need advice and help. I am so fucking heartbroken and empty. Here's the story: I was on and off w this girl and then I came to visit my home country since august or sept and I texted her and we been long distance since then, it's been stable until recently. I turned 17 like a week ago on the 19th(she spent 270$ on me for 2 the weeknd shirts and 2 ovo shirts) and a few days before my bday, I found out she cheated on me with a guy off snap that's just an online guy. She would talk w him casual n then at little times, sexually and send topless pics. I don't get why cause it was just an online guy. Cause of this, there's obviously been a really bad turn. I know I made a huge mistake doing this but I j love her so much and I said I was willing to let it slide since it's just a random online guy she's been talking to for like 2 years. I said she's gonna choose between me or him n she said me and then texted him shi and showed me n then blocked him. However, we still been half bad since and j a few days ago, she's like let's end it, we won't ever be the same with how things have happened already. I'm trying to convince her I'll get over it and all when I know it's bad of me to do this cause I'm disrespecting myself and going so low but fuck I love this girl so much. I'm positive it's dead now and we talk everyday here n there and she still says she loves me. I'm only a teenager, you guys would know more than me about this so please help.

AskMen,,"At your age, how successful do you think dating a 22 year old woman would be?"
AskMen,"Is this a normal experience these days? My dating life

So I’ve been on most dating apps since august last year, haven’t had a single date in all this time despite having numerous matches.
Im 23 year old guy and I may not be the best talker but I can hold and create conversations. Im also an average looking guy who works out. 
So dating apps have been my only way of meeting women. 
Every girl I match with has little to no reciprocation in conversation, ghosts me or doesn’t bother replying.

The girls I have gotten far with have ghosted me on date night and never spoken to me again.

I can give a few specific examples of - was a girl that told me she wanted to meet up, when she was on break from uni, we arranged a few times to meet up and spoke frequently on FaceTime.
Every time it came to that week she said she needed to work due to money which is fine because she was student. Anyway I let that slip a few times but on New Year’s Eve week last year she promised me she’d meet up and it was she that suggested it. I was excited until I heard no response from her a few nights before the date, I just knew she had ghosted me, but it wasn’t until I checked her Instagram New Year’s Day she was sat on some lads lap doing a vid together with drinks only a day after we arranged a supposed date. I was hurt, like quite hurt. But I moved on. 
Until a few moments ago, when I FaceTimed another girl who then proceeded to mock my haircut and laugh at my appearance before hanging up again it doesn’t hurt me attacking my appearance but just doesnt feel like dating is for me. It’s making me bitter and warped, I’d rather give it up at this point.",Is this what dating is like for an average man? 23 (m)

AskMen,"Hello
I am a woman and tend to be overly nice and forgiving to people, at the cost of my happiness. My oldest friend and I have known each other since 1990 and she has repeatedly flaked on the most important events in my life while expecting me to come to hers and help out. Even during my important events that she flakes on she texts me about her needs and what she's doing and it distracts me from enjoying my milestones. She also lies and says she is sick at least once a month to avoid having to reciprocate in the friendship. If she were sick as much as she claims to be, she would not be living anymore. The fact is she lives with a doctor and is probably fine. She doesn't have any diseases or anything. The most annoying part of this relationship is not that she flakes because I learned to expect that decades ago, but that she tries to keep ""the flame"" going by texting me constantly with meaningless and empty messages. I do not want to be cruel but I don't want to keep up this charade anymore, it is not worth my energy. If she were able to be a real reciprocating friend she would have done it decades ago and clearly she has no intention of doing so.

A lot of this was fueled by fear and hesitancy from recently being hurt badly, but not a good excuse I know. Today he ended things because he said our communication is not compatible and he felt like because of that, our connection was lacking.

From my perspective, I totally understand the role I played and how it would be disheartening to interact with someone who isn't engaging fully. However, I always felt like I was present and eager to make IRL plans and felt like our connection was great in person.

I’m talking always being together, talking endlessly and calling 3 minutes after she left to go home, I fell so hard for her and her for me.
We had this massive argument about the pettiest thing ever and by the time we reconciled, I had to move countries.

Ever since then, I’ll find myself sort of talking to several women to gain some sort of satisfaction, going for one and if it goes through, being happy.

It feels good to be vulnerable with someone but it’s hard,  I became official with this girl and after a while, I got this strong urge to break up.
There was no reason, she was sweet, kind , we had a lot in common and I eventually did break up with her.
She sobbed when I did and of course I felt empathy but more then that, I felt relieved that the feeling could go away. 
I think she love bombed me and I kinda freaked out and kinda pushed her away, it felt a bit constraining and now I feel free.

AskMen,"Hey there, I'm a guy (18) and I like a girl (18). So I know her for some more time than a year. We met in a club, she was also my brothers schoolmate in primary school. I knew I liked her for the first time I saw her. The problem was she had a boyfriend at the time. We were friends for some time but than we stopped talking (she also thought that I'm too much confident and that I'm having ego problems, honestly I don't know). Last year in October she asked me if I want to dance with her on prom. I said yes and so we started our dancing lessons in school. I thought that maybe she likes me because of the way she dressed for those lessons or her shyness towards me or how she smiled at me (she smiles quite a lot) etc. Two months ago I decided to ask her out through snapchat. She didn't answer me so in the late morning I decided to delete the message. I deleted a message and tried to forget about her but I couldn't. Also next week after that message I sent it seemed like her interest spiked, because I felt better mood or vibe on next lessons. On friday We had one of our last dancing lessons before prom so I asked her out. I asked her if she would like to go on a drink with me next week. She said yes we can. I said are you sure and she said yes. I said to her I will text her so we make a deal when and where we met and she said good, also she had a smile on her face at that time (through whole lessons I felt good vibe, she was smilling a lot at me and asked me few questions, which were kinda stupid it seemed like she just want's to make some kind of contact with me). I'm not sure why would she say yes but when I asked her a bit more than two months ago if she would like to go out she didn't reply but surely 100% saw a message because she half swipped it and I'm deffinitely sure about that. Her friends don't really like me also. So after all of that I was pretty surprised she said yes. Yesterday at 7 pm I texted her if she is free on tuesdays evening, through snapchat and she didn't answer till 12 am today with ""yes I am"". Why would she do that if she seemed interested when I asked her out and said yes two times, what is happening? I'm very stressed if she said yes maybe just out of pressure.

AskMen,"M(26) A little backstory before I get started: 2 years ago I was homeless sleeping in my car with  little money to my name trying to save up enough to get an apartment. After struggling for 10 months I was able to get enough money together to move into my apartment.

 Fast forward to now I have a fiance and I'm a site supervisor for a security firm. I work Monday through Friday 6:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. but I'm constantly answering phone calls scheduling and guards and basically working off the clock when I'm not pulling a 16 hour shift to cover a call off or a no show. I constantly have people calling off of work or not showing up which puts all the burden on me and I have no other supervisors to help. When I got to this company they were extremely short staffed and I was able to hire six people in a 2-month span. The amount of work that I do is not equal to the amount of compensation I'm getting. I'm not on salary I work hourly so when I'm off the clock I'm not getting paid for all the stuff that I'm doing. My fiance is constantly upset that I'm always on my phone and it feels like I don't have enough time for her.  

On Saturdays when I'm off by I have to spend all day running errands ,cleaning the house, taking care of the dogs ,helping out family while still trying to make time for her. Sunday rolls around and it's more of the same thing if I'm not going in on my day off to cover a shift then I have to take a million phone calls and solve every problem by myself because there's no one else to help me. My fiance is tired of me taking all these calls all the time and now we are arguing alot. If I do get some free time I usually spend it with her but now I feel like I'm close to snapping. I work this hard because I'm afraid of being homeless again but at the rate I'm working I'm going to lose my mind. 

I don't know if I need to get a new job because I can't see the balance this stress at home and at work anymore every week just becomes one big blur because I'm moving non-stop.
I don't have a college degree so my options are limited.

I'm just not sure if I'll be able to support a family if I'm not working this much.

Just looking for some guidance, anything that can help me deal with some of the stress I carry from working home.",How can I find the work-life balance and still support a family?

AskMen,"

I broke up with my ex a year ago. It was the hardest thing i have ever had to do in my life, but it gave me a chance to focus on myself and grow as an individual this past year. I emailed him in December, and he emailed me back essentially saying it’s unfortunate how things ended up, but he still has a strong love for me. He’s been driving 4 hours in my direction every other week to see me, I’ve been driving in his direction on opposing weeks. He just keeps telling me he doesn’t know what he wants, he’s become dead inside since we broke up. He wants a family and wants a life but something holds him back and he can’t even figure his feelings out. He sleeps next to me, holds me, snuggles with me, he lets me kiss him and be affectionate with him… it’s only been 4 months since we started seeing each other again. I made his adoptive son an Easter basket, I’ve made him dinner multiple times, I’ve been sharing my life with him and including him in mine, idk if i should be more patient because I’m the one who walked away, or if i should just let him go? I asked him to tell me if he doesn’t see or want a future with me, because I’ll walk away if that’s the case, but he won’t say that either.

AskMen,"Disclaimer: I'm fully aware that I am taking on far too much, and I hope there's an answer I'm not seeing beyond, *""You're taking on too much.""*

Some background context: I'm an introvert, enjoy my own company, and largely like jobs where I'm mostly left alone to get on with a task.

And yet... (Job One) I'm a Product Manager working in tech. Most of my day, every day, is meetings. Running meetings, preparing things for meetings, running developers through requirements, and so on.

I also have a side business (Job Two) providing content for some education and finance blogs, which has surprisingly grown more than I anticipated. It pays around the same as my PM salary now.

But after hitting my mid-thirties, my disconnect with my main career has really set in. I hate it. I hate how much meeting and camera time I have, and I just don't enjoy the management side at all. For ten years, I've known I'd rather be developing the tech - I've always wanted to be a SWE, but I didn't get a computer science degree.

To complicate things (enter, Job Three), while this isn't really a job as such, I've been publishing fiction on Amazon for a few years (30 novellas and counting) that have done pretty alright. I would love to make a career of this, but it would require me to focus more on it and ideally focus on longer pieces (novels) plus marketing them more.

So, **here's my impasse**... I am salary-trapped. We just bought a house and enjoy a pretty decent disposable income. Part of me thinks about ditching Job One and learning to code while continuing to write. That would free up a lot of time, but it'd cost me circa £4k a month before taxes. I just cannot process the idea of doing that in my mind. Option two could be that I quit client writing and learn to dev on the side, but again, that brings in the same kind of money. Option 3 is I quit publishing, but I LOVE that, and it's more of a hobby, albeit one that pays and can lead to an excellent income stream in future.

Even if I do find a way, I'll be entering the industry as a junior SWE (assuming I can find someone to take the chance as some do, on a self-taught dev) and on likely £25k ish, which is half my salary now anyway.

**TL:DR;** I am burned out and lacking time to get out of my horrid career without significant cost. Is there another solution besides accepting lower money for a while? What would you do in this situation?","At a crossroads with my career, and could use some insight into what to do."

AskMen,"\[REPOST\] Earlier post got removed for 'asking about a specific person or group's actions.' Will try my best  to be as general as possible.

I have been asking guys out more since I've recently accepted that I am confident and attractive enough (though I've only done this a handful of times). I haven't been rejected, but I haven't been able to take things further. I keep getting ghosted. I'm wondering if it's because of my approach. 

Recently, I asked for a good looking guy's number in public during the daytime when he was with his friend. I walked up to him with a big smile and said, 'excuse me, I think you're cute. Can I ask for your number?' He was a tiny bit surprised (and so was his friend), but said yes right away. We had a bit of small talk (he was quite shy) as he put his number in my phone. As I was walking away, I heard his friend laugh and say 'no way.' I shot him a text message that night saying it was nice to meet him and made a joke about something we talked about. No reply!

Of course, I would love to meet people more naturally by being friends or seeing them regularly first, but you can't really do that with strangers. The whole asking-for-their-number approach seems sort of superficial, but its the only way I know of at the moment.",How to ask for a guy's number?

AskMen,"Two of my work friends (M) and I (F) were discussing an issue that had some socioeconomic mileage.  I don't know them well enough, so I've never felt comfortable with addressing their background in any way during a conversation. In this instance, I was trying to explain my reasoning in a very generic manner. But then suddenly one of these guys just erupted at me -- he started yelling, and when I tried to say something to ease things, he kept cutting me off aggressively. He also made multiple personal remarks that I felt were uncalled for. I was too stunned, and at first I thought I'd done something wrong. For my own sanity, I later spoke to the other friend who witnessed this, and he confirmed that I hadn't said anything personal that would have justified that sort of reaction. He too had felt very shocked and uncomfortable by the way things unfolded.  Besides this incident, this guy tends to be quite presumptuous; I don't really like this kind of behavior, but I could give that the benefit of the doubt at least. However, this incident pushed me over the edge. 

I have very few close male friends, and so I was wondering whether my reaction was tempered by my lack of experience with male friendships. I've seen people raise their voices in heated debates, I've done it too, but this felt very different. The anger was specifically directed at who I was, as suggested by his remarks about me. And although that might not have been the intention, the sight of a guy twice your height and weight screaming at you does feel threatening (again, he probably didn't intend this, but this was unfortunately my gut reaction). I tried to act normal afterwards (he never apologized or showed any regret), but now I'm questioning my decision to pretend as though nothing happened. I don't understand why I should be the one struggling to keep up a cordial front after being on the receiving end of the shitstorm? Or am I just overreacting here, and should try to forget about this? Really how normal is this behavior?",How normal is it for a guy to scream at you during a heated conversation?

AskMen,"Two years ago I broke up with my girlfriend of 7 months because of different religious beliefs. We both loved each other but I felt guilty staying with her because I thought things like getting married and having kids would be an issue. There was nothing wrong with our relationship, she was great and beautiful, but in my head I felt like I needed to find someone of my own faith and culture. I didn’t have the courage to chose the life I wanted and instead, I broke her heart. I thought it was the right thing to do. 

Anyways, as I grew over the past couple years I’ve come to realize how rare someone like that is, and that our differences could’ve been overcome. I’ve been in other relationships since but none of them felt as genuine as they were with my ex. The reasons for ending things were due to my own insecurities and now looking back, I think I could’ve compromised on a lot of things that she was willing to, and I was not. 


I hate myself for making this decision and can’t forgive my past self - I think about her everyday. She’s with a good guy now and I’m happy for her, but man I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to love someone again that intensely. She was utterly in love with me and I threw it all away. 

I’m 25 now and I genuinely think I won’t be able to ever find someone like that again. And this is not coming from a place of low self-esteem. I mean statistically speaking girls of that caliber just aren’t single anymore at my age. She was out of my league beautiful, model body, studying to be a doctor, always smiling, and just so caring.  

I guess I’d just like to see if anyone else had a similar experience or some advice on how to forgive myself for not having the balls to live my own life with the girl I loved? Two years is a long time to feel pain over someone you miss, and I’m beginning to think that this mistake will haunt me for the rest of my life.",What are some ways to move on and forgive yourself for past mistakes?

AskMen,"I went back to school a couple of years ago to get my engineering degree, while I was at school I’ve met a few friends around my age who are pretty cool. One of the guys is your prototypical (way above average) good looking tall guy who never really has to try to attract women, just constantly and easily happens for him. I on the other hand consider myself above average and I do alright with women, I’m not drowning in them but I’m not hurting. 

Well I’ve noticed when at school or in class we’re real cool with each other we go out on the weekends and shoot the shit hit some bars, but whenever he has a new girl and goes out with her and her friends or hanging out that night with other women, I’ve noticed he’ll lie and tell me he’s not really doing anything that night or he’s just going to hang out with his girl that night and then will basically tell me on Monday about how fun and how many girls his girlfriend (or girl he’s dating) has and all the shit they did that night, knowing he told me they were doing nothing that night. I don’t want to seem to petty so I usually just ignore him and just smile make a few quips and move on. Also he’ll invite most of our friend group except one other guy (including me) and always invites a friend in our group that is engaged and about to be married. 

But this weekend, I noticed in he was hanging out with his girl and her huge group of friends, all nurses who were celebrating their graduation. When I called and asked him what he was doing he lied and said he was going home for the night. Only to find out from my one friend and his roommate when I saw them later on at night that he and the rest of our little friend group was back at his place with all the girls having a little party. 

Sure enough though the next day he text me back asking for the notes we need for the next test in one of our engineering class.

We had a date together and It was honestly one of the best dates I had so far. The conversation flowed amazingly, we ended up the night kissing but she did not wanted to have sex because she said she doesn’t do it so fast because she feels insecure. 

Then 2 months later, we ended up working abroad again in the same place and she kept texting me asking me if I was going to come to work with her and that she was super excited to have me here. 

Now I tried two times to go on a date with her and she only answers me “maybe we should go next time :)” and she speaks about looking for someone to be with her and travel the world and I’m literally that person. She gives more attention to other people when I’m there. 

The weird thing is, is that she always invites me to do activities but with other friends. 

I noticed that she laughs at all my jokes. When I hug her I feel her really close. And she agrees to things that I say.

Hi all, I know there is way to tell, but I’d really appreciate your thoughts on this as I’m pretty confused/curious! 

From the ages of 14-15, I went on a low-fat diet, high protein and dropped weight to around 44-47kg at 5’3. I was very active, just quite skinny and had no muscle.

By 16, I started eating more and gradually grew taller to 5’5 at 17; then 5’6 at 19; and am now 21 and recently grew a tad to 5’7. 

For context, my parents are 4’11 and 5’8, so I’m hoping I can at least grow taller than my dad haha!

But what really confused me is that since I started to eat way more dietary fats  and bulk up, I have started to grow a bit of facial hair (from having barely anything my entire life); my downstairs has grown; my libido is way up; and I’m starting to get acne.

So my question is; did under-eating as a young teen stunt/delay my development?; and also, could I still be growing at 21 as a late bloomer?

Thanks for your time :)",What are the chances I’m still developing?

AskMen,"I’m not dating this guy yet. I’m 22 female, he’s 23. And he seems so obsessed with me. We met on a dating app and haven’t had the first meeting yet, but we arranged a meeting for the next month to see if we click irl (we’ve know each other for a month now). The problem is - after 4 days of knowing each other, he told me he loves me which I found a little crazy. I told him it was waaaaaaaay to fast and that I do want to give it a chance (he seems a decent guy), so I wanted to go for it slowly and just start as friends. The thing is - we are not in a relationship, but he wants to spend every single second of the day with me and already uses pet names. It makes me uncomfortable and I also feel a little controlled as he keeps asking me when I have to go to uni, when I’ll be back, when I have a break, what I’m doing and when I’ll finish what I’m doing. Is that normal for a guy to fall in love so easily? I’ve been in only one relationship, but we caught feelings after 6 months or so. That guy has never been in a relationship on the other hand.

We do follow each other on social media and send a few memes back and forth randomly but that’s as far as we communicate besides playing online together literally every single day for the past few weeks. We have a very flirty “friendship” where we jokingly banter and argue all of the time while playing the game. Other people that play with us constantly ask if we’re a couple and say we’re flirting. However, I’m starting to develop feelings for but it’s like he hates me! When I try to be nice and have normal conversations, he still continues to be mean to me. He’ll either have a rude tone or I’ll ask him a question and he’ll catch an attitude and just insult me (say I’m asking stupid questions, etc). Then other times he will be nice(r) to me. Or have an attitude when I even mention something about another guy.

AskMen,,men of reddit: How did or would you react to a woman asking you out?
AskMen,"I'm in my 30s. I'm Asian. I've been told several times that I look younger than my age. So I'm at the bar on my own, had a rough couple days at work and just wanted to enjoy some good food and have a couple drinks; eat good food, drinks, leave in a timely manner. 

2 white guys sat next to me (each on opposite sides) within minutes. They ordered their drinks promptly, I was deliberating what to order.
Neither of them got carded when they ordered and then when I ordered my drink when asked by the bartender, bartender ask for my ID. Again, not the first time this has happened and I don't usually take offense to it. 

But today, it was a little different. I was on my own. The guy next to me made a comment along the lines of ""how I wish I was still being carded"". I retorted with ""I'm offended"" in sort of a quick handed return. 
The bartender chimed in and said along the lines of  ""don't worry you'll get there"". 
I wasn't TOO bothered by it. Got my drink and food, enjoyed it and towards the end of my meal, it hit me, that the specific interaction made me a bit uncomfortable. I felt teamed up against, discriminated in a way. 

I got home and reasoned with it myself a bit. I felt ostracized. If the restaurant had a policy to card customers, why aren't you carding everyone else then? This specific bartender, when I asked about a specific dish (Portuguese Stuffed Calamari: it was quite good actually) before all this even happened, literally said, its tinned, good quality, pretty known by the Europeans for having it (in Europe, and that it was catching fame in the US). Nothing about the food itself, granted there was a line of description of what it actually was, but there are some things I'm not familiar with. Overall, I wasn't planning to have any other interactions at the bar. I just wanted to eat and go but after this happened, it just didn't seem to sit right with me. 

I guess I'm feeling tired with the need to keep hearing ""oh you look young it's a privilege/you're so lucky"". This isn't something I can control. It was also made very obvious. Things usually fly past me and I'm mostly not aware or at least not letting it absorb my mental space. 
It's starting to feel Karen-esque, now that I'm even mentioning it. 

I'm not asking anyone to make me feel good about myself but more so, I just wanted to be treated equally. Card me, fine, then card others too. 

I'm not a fan of bringing race into the matter but I also wonder if it is some form of microaggression. 

I tipped over 20% still despite all that.

I was told that it means something else, like a man's income and how tall he is blah blah blah... and honestly it sounds pretty degrading towards men in my opinion.

AskMen,"It seems like any time I go out of my way to purchase an item for myself, my s/o sees that and wants something in return. I’ll try saving up money for a high-ticket item and when she finds out, she’ll randomly start asking for $100 here or $200 there. She has questioned my ability to “save money” and so has her family asked my personal savings. Besides the fact it’s non of her families business what I possess, I personally don’t think she should be talking about MY finances with her family. I put in the work through a trade program and landed my first job in the industry. Before that I only worked part-time making $17/hour, and I was definitely never asked to be spending money this often. Yeah I’m slightly better off now but i’m still living under my means and try to save what I can In this economy. I wear the same clothes for a while (hardly buy clothes) and sometimes she’s given me shit for wearing the same clothes.

Iv'e been having trouble lately. Besides suspecting I have ADHD, the main thing is that i have a to do list of 50 things, with only 10 'really' needing to be done. So, youd probably say 'well spader, just do those 10 and do the other 40 later'. Sure, but then theres 50 MORE things the next day, even if only 10 are 'must be done'. You can probably see the problem; the list keeps growing. Now you may say ""Spader, just do all of them"" which is silly but my current 'goal'. It usually fails tremendously or if im lucky and get them all done, its the end of the day, bed time, and i have 50 more things to do tomorrow.

AskMen,"Just a quick summary of my life, I'm in my twenties, out of college trying to go back for masters. I had a very strong anti-social streak as a teenager, wasn't interested in making friends, hanging out, without a community as I became an atheist. Growing older and wiser, I kinda see where I was wrong, and I really put myself out there and had a social life in my last semester after spending the other years as a loner. Now out of college, everybody's moving on, as they should, but I am having a hard time coming to terms that my best is already behind me and only loneliness lies in front of me. Add to that I had an inappropriately timed crush on one of my closest friends and I told her and I am keeping my distance so I can move on and the walls keep closing in. This is kinda funny because my teenage self would've been ecstatic at the opportunity for a life with nobody.

-I'll hug u after I got this done, can u wait for that?

She has few guy friends she has to work with all day and sometimes late night since the past 2 months, she mentioned that they would give her head massage for her headache and take care of her when she is not feeling well and she considers them her best friends(she met them after we started dating).

She has a flirty nature as well, I talked with her about this but she says its her nature and she jokingly flirts with her friends and all her friends does this.

In general she is an extrovert and has a lot of friends and I am an introvert so I try to hide my jealousy but sometimes it becomes difficult, also as this is my first relationship so sometimes unsure what to do.

AskMen,"I (woman) met a guy at a work event ( we don't work together but are in the same industry). He came up to me and complimented my work. Later he emailed me to meet up and chat about the industry again. Things were a little awkward at first because there were some 'date vibes' (maybe?) he insisted on paying for my drink and we had a pretty intimate chat. While he definitely talked about mostly things related to our field - he also shared things about his dating life, asking if it was okay - which I encouraged because frankly unknowingly to him-  I am in a position where I'm interested in exploring and having fun sexually and find him cute. Whenever he would mention things about 'dates' he would make eye contact, complimented me a lot not only on my work but also that he felt I was very funny (tho not sure if that is a flirtatious trait). But the problem is because it was a professional 'meeting' and I get the sense as he mentioned he's a 'nice empathetic guy - he would never make a move to cross that boundary. I also had no idea how to give him a signal without potentially risking sexual harassment or ruining my reputation in our work field (though we don't work together, I still wouldn't want word to get around if I was forward and he felt harassed!!) 

Anyway, overall it went okay - he did seem to talk way too much sometimes but maybe he was nervous? He apologized for talking to much at the end even though I didn't outrightly say that he did.

Turns out most of her male friends are exes or people she’s had a fling with from years back. One even invited her out for drinks recently as he’s newly single and apparently thought she must have been to. She claims she set him straight, but continues to converse with him.

Now I don’t think anything’s actually going on with them or any others for that matter, but this behavior doesn’t sit well with me.

Grabbing nail clippers, I saw the pills behind a half zippered part and well, I kept checking after we'd have sex if there was some missing.

All his coworkers are women older than him (he’s 21). He’s also severely underpaid compared to his coworkers. He’s worried if he says no then his coworkers will all think he’s rude since they’re all friends (since they are all women, he’s kind of isolated). He’s in supply chain by the way. 

As a woman I don’t know what it’s like being the only man in the workplace. Right now he can’t quit because he’s worried about job security and the recession going on (in the US).

What I said is to always look polite and to essentially guilt trip them to realize what they are doing. Like if someone asks you to do something say “Hey I’m sorry but I’m currently doing [this this and this] so if I take on your work, I would have to stay longer and I’m really sorry. If I didn’t have so much on my plate I would’ve loved to help you out.” but he said it doesn’t matter and his coworkers will all think he’s rude anyways.

My first though was okay I wouldn't call him a POS. Maybe he just wanted some space to heal emotionally? Or give her some space so it wasn't awkward. And I posed this potentially and was immediately shot down by all the women in chat and the streamer. And my first thought was it seems like these women feel entitled to still have the guys attention/interest when he made his intentions clear and was told no. And he respected that no. Just feels weird and double standard because women will do the exact same thing and spout how them ""ghosting,"" is the best thing to do for both parties emotionally.

AskMen,"He loves me too much, he thinks he's hurting me.

For context, I (f18) and my boyfriend (m18) have been dating for 6 months. We want to have a long term, serious relationship. From the beginning, we talked about religion being something that could complicate things and agreed that as long as we dont force the others beliefs it will be fine.

 We haven't had sex, as its something we both want to hold off till marriage, but we've done other things, which by my religion I'm not supposed to do. But that is something I am completely okay with, want and I see as a sort of compromise I'm happy to make as long as we can still keep our boundary of no sex before marriage. (I have a child from a previous relationship) I don't know how to make him understand that he's exactly what I've been looking for, and I love him for who he is. He feels like he's not good enough because his standards are lower than mine, and would discourage/make it easier for me to sin. He told me I'm not seeing how he's hurting me, taking our intimacy as an example. 

My past relationship, and talking stages were completely disorganized, toxic and even abusive. He has showed me what a healthy relationship can look like, but because of religion he feels like he's not good enough for me. Yet i see these as things that would happen anyways, and in any/every possible future relationship I have, which is why I'm ok with and in fact want that sort of closeness with him. Although its true that if I found somebody of my own religion, who held those standards, it would make things easier.  I think such temptations would happen anyways,  and would end the same way,  or even worse. 

He thinks he's hurting me, which I don't believe it's the case here. And I'm afraid he will break things off, because he'd believe thats the best thing for me, when to me its not a big deal, and i planned from the start to compromise on it. Religion aside,  he's my dream guy, from the way he treats me,  to the type of person he is. I love him as he is. 

Is anyone in a mixed religion relationship that could give me advice on how you've worked through it, or any men that could give me his side  prespective and how to help him?","Men, how do i help my bf overcome his fead of not being good enough due to religion?"

I am a 26 year old male dating a 24 year old female. We are both 100% straight. 

I don’t have any make role model that o can trust, so please try to give me your best advice. 

My gf met a girl named Jenna a month ago who is a lesbian. My girlfriend is 100% straight. 

Jenna is friends with Michael who goes to school with my gf. I’ve met everyone and I get along with everyone. I noticed that Jenna tries to make her ex gf jealous by posting pictures with my gf. My gf laughs and only has gone along with it once. They’re all hanging out right now (I’m away on a work trip) and my gf sent me a pic with her showing some cleavage standing next to Jenna, to which she said Jenna sent it to her ex gf to make her jealous. Jenna flirts with my gf but my gf has shut her down every time, even in front of me. My gf thinks this is all funny but I seriously am starting to feel as though it is disrespectful. My gf is very rude to her if she tries to flirt with her and tells me about all the occasions that anything happens. 

Jenna is a boxer and as am I. She jokingly challenged me to a fight in front of everyone but I refused since she is 5 inches shorter than me and 45 pounds less. We all laughed and moved on

Am I being crazy and overthinking ? Any advice on this would be appreciated, thanks. English isn’t my first language so I apologize for any mistakes","How can I handle a lesbian flirting with my girlfriend blatantly in front of me? (Serious, pls help)"

I need some help to explain what I experienced. I (M/35) experienced what I think was a fully body, prolonged orgasm. 

Context: Wife and I had smoke and decided to do our thing. We have a good time and then decide to get a snack. We return to the bed about 20 minutes later-ready for round 2. The second time around was much more intense. We are going at it for about 15 minutes and she is spent. I roll her over in prone bone and go to town. I can feel the climax building up and I get to the brink and pulled out, but I didn’t ejaculate like I usually do, but I could feel the sensation washing over my whole body. 

I roll over and I have this strong urge to stroke it, so I do. I have never had multiple back to back, so that is why I am trying to figure out what exactly happened next. 

About 30 seconds into finishing the job, I feel another O building, I start to cum but the sensations is now radiating through my whole body. I came, but I kept cumming-for a good 15-20 straight seconds. Once I start to feel the sensation begin to dissipate, I start to feel it build again, and then I came again. This happened another 3 times within a 5 minute window. I finally decided that I was done, but whenever I flexed my toes, I could still slightly feel the sensation-this lasted another 2-3 minutes. 

All in all, I had an orgasm that lasted about 8-10 minutes. I just want to understand so that I can 1) achieve again or 2) realize that I just unlocked something. 

TLDR;",What did I experience? Fully body male O?

AskMen,"I’ve been dating my girlfriend for almost 5 years now and love my girlfriend’s dad. We get along really well. But for some reason I occasionally find myself trying to find reasons to tear him down and get a little excited when my girlfriend says something negative about him. I don’t feel that way all the time and in fact I defend him from negative comments frequently, but like I said I occasionally have these bad thoughts. I was talking to him about some accomplishment my girlfriend’s grandpa (his father in law) was telling me about and he starts making comments that really tried to diminish what he did. I told my girlfriend about it and she said he’s made comments about her grandpa like that before.

So now I’m wondering if this is some natural thing that all guys feel, or if him and I are both just assholes. I’ve put some thought into it and it seems to me that it’s coming from a place of jealousy. My girlfriend is really close to her dad and my girlfriend’s mom has a similar relationship with her dad. She still goes to her dad for advice and comfort a lot when I feel like I could give her those things.

Like I said, I could just be an asshole. The thoughts are pretty intrusive, and for the most part I don’t say them out loud to anyone. Maybe it’s a circumstance of this particular father daughter relationship or maybe a natural thing that many people feel. So I’m just curious what others have experienced?",How common is it to have negative thoughts about your SO’s dad even when you like him?

Last night my roommates (young couple in their 20's) were arguing quite passionately. Eventually things escalatee until one of my roommates started screaming ""Stop"", ""Let me go"", and ""Help me.""

The whole house woke up and my other two roommates took the angle of ""It's late and we have work tomorrow morning"" and I don't know if I'm too compassionate for my own good but I wanted to know if things had gotten physical.

It's very triggering for me because my dad abused my mom, and whenever I see couples arguing regardless of how well I know them, it brings back those old feelings of guilt because I was a child and did nothing when it was my mom, and now I feel the need the act differently as an adult. To stand up for what's right.

My wife always says I go through deodorant way too fast.  I've never really put much stock in to it, because she says that about everything.  In other words, I feel its her mostly bitching that I'm spending money.  


But today I've realized, maybe I DO actually use WAY too much.  The last time I bought some, I ordered a 4 pack from Amazon of Dove Men + Care Antiperspirant.  I could tell that my last stick is about to run out.  So today I went to place another order.  Out of curiosity, I went to see when I last ordered some.  And holy shit, I only ordered that 4 pack a month and a half ago.  That means I'm going through about a stick every 11 days.  When I googled how long one should last, it comes back with 3 - 6 months.  I'm not even sure how you could make one last that long.  


When I apply mine, I usually do a good swath down.  Then maybe a couple more to fill in the areas that werent covered.  I'd say at most, its about 2 complete swipes across the entire armpit.

Following which we talked almost every day without fail. Even exchanging instagrams, sending pics of our dogs and updating each other on our lives. I didnt want to move our relationship so quickly hence i waited till ard the 3rd week mark to ask her out. (Which i thought was quite reasonable, not too rush to meet a stranger and not too long that made the whole relationship feel dead and dry. (Can't be texting forever right?) 

So i jst casually asked on weds if she has any plans on Friday. She tried to ""act blur"" and said she had work. 

Being the thicked skin person i was. I proceeded to reply with ""HAHAH who doesnt😭😭 I meant friday night!"" I also gave an explanation of ""I have 20$ voucher for cinema and I was wondering if she wnna watch a movie""

That way I dont look too despo if she rejects. As if she does reject i will jst say another friend agreed to it. I even said if she has plans, then its okay (so there is no pressure) She has not replied me since.

Honestly I think shes not interested to go out either cos shes scared (afterall we did meet on the internet) or she is jst not interested (cannot really be seen thru her text msgs tho, which are all very positive.) She has not blocked me on tele nor remove me from instagram tho😭

So ya i jst wnna jot down my thoughts and hope to get some advice! thanks for reading up till now!",I asked a girl out after chatting for 3 weeks. She has not replied me since. What do i do?

AskMen,"One day, I found myself scrolling through old Facebook photos &amp; videos and felt like my life slipped away over time. I used to be in a band, lead my youth-group activities, travel with my friends to different provinces, failed in class (but passed the ones I liked). This went on from 2013 until 2021, when I joined the army. It's 2023 now, and none of the friends I had back then I'm in touch with now. I feel like my day is as mundane as doing PT, showing up to work, and tidying up for the next day (and gaming if I have free time). I just feel like my life slipped away over time. The question keeps probing my head asking me, ""What the hell was I thinking letting all of that go?""

Skipped a lot of class in college to do bad shit; had to drop out cause grades were bad and I needed a job (the army took me in because I had work experience).

Boys, *what should I do from now on to be more fulfilled?* There were things like playing the guitar &amp; piano which I loved to do back then... I haven't touched some of these instruments for years, can I pick up the hobby again? Should I reconnect with old friends? I've shut too many people out and I just feel a huge pang of **guilt** and **regret**, which stops me from talking to anyone. I'm introverted as hell, too. It's hard for me to make new friends, and when I do, I end up isolating myself from them.

So far here are things I've tried that have actually worked for me:

1. Started going to the gym. Managed to become more confident in my appearance, which has bugged me since I was a kid.
2. Learning Japanese. Was interested in this language for a long time, and I've made surprising progress doing it. I find great comfort when I learn new kanji and vocab.

AskMen,"I have been seeing this girl for 9 months and we have been living together for the last 5 months. We are exclusive, but not yet in a formal relationship. I have asked her very early on, and she said she is not ready yet. Even I am not sure if Im ready yet, so I just let things flow naturally while keeping my hopes low.

She is not perfect, nobody is, but lately I feel like i I am the one putting in too much effort compared to her. I dont like this. The highs have been very blissful, we pretty much lived like a married couple. But the lows also have been very low, like we fight a lot.

Its holiday season where we are at, so we went back to our seperate hometowns, and will be seperated for the next week or so. Being seperated now, gives me time to ponder, just how much she wants us to work. Also, it makes me realize how much I enjoy being alone, as I am a very introverted.

So my question is, what actions that I could take, in order to see where this is going? I think I am willing to take the shot, and if she is still not ready, I am prepared myself.

I want to see how much she values our relationship and if she really willing to put in her efforts, at least matching mine.

Any ideas guys? I am not that experienced with this kind of women. She likes to tell me one thing, but her actions sometimes contradicts her words. And I am more like the actions speaks  louder kinda guy. 

My idea is to show her my waning levels of attractions, tapering her off slowly. Anyways, we WILL be seeing each other again in the coming weeks, and I only see two outcomes.

1. We break off whatever we had
2. We make it official

As for me, I gained peach fuzz 3 months after my 16th bday and gained 7-8 inches right before my 16th bday. Almost 2 years later, I'm 18 and nothing has changed. I'm exceptionally hairy on my legs and arms, but I have basically 0 chest, body or facial hair. I haven't increased in height, and my weight is permanently stuck at 47 kgs (i eat on avg 2500 to 3000 kcal a day, so that's just the way it is). 

In the last 2 years, all I've gotten is a jawline. My friends used to tell me I looked 12, now I look 15. It doesn't help that all my friends and family are omega tall. 

People keep saying It'll eventually happen, or that I'll be the shit when I'm 40, but c'mon, its easy to say, not easy to experience.

I'm not frustrated that I get bullied for it, cuz I don't. I'm just frustrated cuz I'm tired of waiting. I already waited yrs to hit puberty, now I have to wait again.

AskMen,"hi - i'm not familiar with reddit so much, so don't come for me.

GUYS ONLY metropolitan areas who are between the ages 22-34. i am conducting market research as i am the cofounder of a dating app. biggest problem we're having is there are disproportionately more women than men (80% women). The gender split is causing the users who are straight women to delete, write negative reviews, or tell friends about a bad experience with the app because there aren't enough options for them to match with. this problem will determine the literal viability of our business so i figured i would reach out to reddit. i NEED to figure out how to attract both genders.

the app is for double dates. single friends pair up with one another and create a shared team profile. then they look through other teams who match their preferences. when they match, a group chat is generated and they can plan to meet irl. it's called fourplay (cheeky name is one big thing we have going for us!!). so here are my big overarching questions for straight guys:

1. Would you go on a double date?
2. If you would go on a double date, why? What is compelling about a double date?
3. If you wouldn't go on a double date, why? No other single friend to ask?? Find it awkward? Feel free to be specific
4. If you don't use dating apps, why? (maybe there is something here that we can solve in our app)

i left my job of 8 years as a nurse to pursue this dream full time. it was a huge risk but i really think we can figure this out and make the product something people really want/need. willing to listen and deliver on the feedback. pleeeease help me!!!!",How do single guys feel about double dates??

I would like to ask you lovely gentlemen some tips on how to find guys. They say that guys know each other best, so I am asking for your wisdom. I drifted off from my high school friends long ago, and I have been working nonstop here in Korea. I only have my family here, and know nobody else. It is hard to find someone here in Korea who is a guy, single, and not my dad or grandfather's age. I have tried Tinder &amp; okcupid(a lot of catfish, scammers, fake profiles, and people who only want to hook up), similar dating sites, and churches(a lot of guys who wanted a ""calm and submissive wife"" wtf. A bit too restrictive; American and European church guys are nice and cool, Asian church guys are a bit old fashioned in their thinking. I told them that I drank a beer a month and they treated me like an alcoholic). I would like to get to know some Real guys(no robots please) human, preferably near my age. The problem is that I have bad luck with guys; the 3 times that I tried to make a move was bad. They were too young and had girlfriends(they looked normal, and the think was that they looked mature.

AskMen,[removed],"Men of reddit, what are the things you'd do for a woman you are determined to be in a relationship with?"
AskMen,"I find that I like to talk to a lot of men, but when I decide I want to become intimate with a guy (like sex) then I only focus on him and the other men drop off.

I find it so peculiar that people can have sex with multiple people whilst dating multiple people at the same time.

This is why I find it best to friendzone all men, until one comes to the forefront and we take the next step into intimacy together. People have told me this is the European dating style and that's what I tend to like. You simply have the tacit assurance that there is no one else you're being intimate with or having sex with once you get to that level. 

**Americans tend to date/ have sex with multiple people at the same time and personally, I find that's offputting and a turn-off.**  

When I date a guy, I want his entire focus on me and vice versa, so that there's no one else in the picture. If I sense a guy is a player, fckboy, dating and having sex with multiple women, still talking to his ex, have numerous FWBs, I usually don't say yes to a second date or seriously think about him as a someone I would want to date. He is permanently friendzoned.

I was raised by a single mom, grew up around almost exclusively women, and so all my friends growing up were mostly girls. I never really had any male role models. That means I've never been exposed to typical masculine activities - sports, cars, etc; or even been super good at establishing male friendships.

Now the thing is, this stuff actually seems interesting to me. But I've never had the social circle to really expose me to it. Like, basketball and football and cars and building shit all seems genuinely cool but it feels like a foreign language to me because I've never been exposed to it. Seems like I'm stuck in this loop where in order to make guy friends, I need to know this stuff, but in order to know this stuff I need to be exposed to it by having male friends.

Does anyone have any advice as to how to break it and make some cool, genuine, masculine interests and hobbies? I really feel like I don't know where to start.

(To clarify, this isn't me changing myself to be viewed as more masculine.

Fast forward a few years after high school and I run into him at a club where he was playing at with his band. He came up and say hi but I kind of shot him down at the time as I was with my ex. Ever since that day I saw him again something inside of me ignited about him. I have since broken up with my ex and I’ve tried to find my way back to him (my crush). It has been 2 years since and we’ve matched on a different dating apps but conversation never really took off due to either him or I already entangled with other people, and timing was never there. I remember one night out of pure impulse I sent him a message saying I wanted to shoot my shot  and see if he was interested. The day after I sent the message I saw that he got into a relationship so I unsent the message before he could see it.

I was on varsity last year, and although I didn't play much because of seniors ahead of me I felt like I made good progress technique wise and strength wise. This spring ball, just 2 days in, coach doesn't play me. Like, I get maybe 2-5 reps the whole 2 hours of practice, even though I make a good effort to take in the coaching and improve. I'm not the biggest guy on the offensive line nor the strongest, and with that how can I get more playing time? It's not only demoralizing but no matter how much I try, the coaches don't seem to notice.

AskMen,"I'm a single mom with 2 toddlers, have been separated since January 2022 and am waiting for my divorce to be finalized. I met an amazing man a few days before Christmas, and we're still going great. I feel so strongly for him and am wondering: when the heck should I tell him I love him?

He said he wanted a ""casual"" relationship when we first started talking. He verbalizes that I'm ""cute"", ""pretty"" and he has ""lots of fun"" with me, that he ""loves how you take care of me"" because I give him massages nearly every time we're together - that's all he's really ever said about how he feels about my looks or presence. That sometimes makes me feel like I'm misreading him, but his actions show me a lot more. He:

• checks in with me at least once a day &amp; offers me advice on things that trouble me

• pays for most of our meals together

• bought me a smartwatch because I joined a gym to get healthier

• he's crafting me a walking stick he cut from the river

• the sex is absolutely insane bonkers and I've never in my life imagined so much sensual pleasure. He's a big cuddler and makes sure my pleasure is attended to every time we're together. He nearly always gets me off before he does.

He's met my kids and my mother a few times when walking her property, and he's mentioned me meeting his mom twice now.

BUT. Is it too weird that I'm still legally married? At this rate, we've been dating 4 months and I won't be legally free until Thanksgiving. I've had to stop myself numerous times from just saying it, and quickly turn it into, ""I love holding you"", ""I love how strong you are"", ""I love being with you"", that's as close as I've gotten.

AskMen,"Today I (18M) was at school and during last period while we were on the hallways I see my gf’s brother (15M) walking with an unusual and funny looking jacket. I start teasing him about it, and then, the situation escalates…

He grabs me by my shirt, I slap his hand off me, he back slaps my chest weak asf, then he put down his silly jacket and iPad like if he was getting ready to fight. He’s taller and bigger than me, I’m quite the average folk at 5’7 160lbs, he’s around 5’10 and around 15-20 pounds heavier. Yet, we size each other up and while he’s aggressively talking to me, I just calmly say “are you seeing what you are doing”, “you’re acting like a child over a joke”.

After this small exchange of words he tries to slap my hand out of my shrugging pose which I did nothing about beside still holding my “what the fuck are you doing this for” body language.

During this whole altercation my objective was to take an assertive approach, but truth is, I was nervous as hell during the entirety of the situation. See, when physical threats are in question, I get nervous, and I’m sure that as much as I try to keep my body language, some of that nervousness escapes me and somehow shows.

I used to fight a lot as a kid, but I got my ass beat once and since then tried to always divert these type of problems.

Anyways, am I being to much of a pussy for being nervous and not getting as physical as him? I feel like that I didn’t get as mad as he just touched my chest and hands, but I somehow feel I let him stomp over me, in front of people.

¿What can I do to fix this? It is not the first time I don’t escalate as much as the other person when maybe I should’ve, this is just the most vivid and recent example of ‘em. I dunno, it didn’t seem like fighting over some fucking jacket was worth it, but maybe it wasn’t about the jacket anymore, it was about my manhood.",I feel like I’m being too much of a pussy when it comes to conflict…

I've been looking for a job five times since I graduated for different reasons and it's actually not that bad:

- I can get back to some companies that already contacted me once and usually they're still interested 
- I get relatively clear requirements what qualifications they're looking for
- both sides make a roughly equal effort to arrange dates and get to know each other
- if they're interested, they clearly tell you

So job searching is easily my favorite. If dating where anything like thar, it would be paradise.

AskMen,"I’ve always struggled with my appearance, for the longest time I could remember I’ve hated how I looked. 

A couple months after a toxic relationship I decided to change that by losing over 100 pounds in 4 months. (I’m not bragging it’s just for context)

Because of this weight change my appearance is starkly different now than how it was before. 

I’m a 6’2 165 moderately attractive male who now struggles with my own appearance since my brain still believes I am that fat fuck I used to be. 

Anywhoozer, since I didn’t used to get much attention, now I struggle with the ability to control what I do with people who give it to me. 

For many months now I have been with different girls who either we didn’t really work well together or I was being used.

But recently I’ve been noticing how some of the girls I talk to or fuck/ give head to really couldn’t give a shit about me as a person. (Crazy revelation ik) 

I know that I am directly responsible for this feeling through my actions but it doesn’t feel nice to be someone’s toy when you are just trying to not feel alone and connect with some one.

So question is again how tf do I deal with this?",How does one cope with being used and can I change? (Pls help)

After having emerged from an extremely toxic, 15-year sexless marriage, I have very few lady friends, but I want to meet more women. 

I have this limiting belief that women DO NOT want to be approached by men, and that any and all efforts by men to do so immediately raise extreme caution, expectations of s€xual intent and overall creepiness. 

Example 1: I am doing yard work in my well-to-do neighborhood and a woman around my age walks by a couple of times a day. She’s alone. I’m alone. It’s a moderately busy street with cars coming by and people walking around. Do I approach her and talk about my tomato plants and flowers? 

Example 2: I’m at a local art exhibition and see a woman alone at the venue looking at the art. Do I strike up a conversation about art?

I work for a large company in construction. There are many people from different parts of UK. I’m from Manchester, and there are men older than me (a group of 4, in their 30’s) from London.

There's another one at work I really don't want to mess up haha

AskMen,[removed],Have You Ever Ghosted/Ignored In-Person Friend Instead of Just Saying No?
AskMen,"Because online dating is fucking poison - but at the same time I hear women claim they're looking for boyfriends, but all the ones I meet seem to be engaged with partners and don't seem very interested in connecting, even when I try to talk to them.

So women are desperate for boyfriends and waiting for men to approach them - or getting millions of matches online.

And men are desperate for girlfriends and wasting hours and hours swiping right on these fucking apps for nothing.

It's depressing. How much time can you spend on the shitter swiping on photos of beautiful women who will all reject you?

You'll get a bloody hemorrhoid and put your legs to sleep before you ever swipe on someone real and meet a woman who wants to date and be your girlfriend that leads to something real.

You're better off reading a book than swiping swipping swipping till you got no thumb prints.

I think men and boys are better off trying to form romantic connections with women and girls in real life - except apparently we're disincentivising that?

How often do guys actually get accused of being a creep? This idea is being spread on Tik Tok - like you'll be MeToo'd because you try to strike up a conversation with someone in real life - it's distorted thinking.

I've asked at least ten women out in the past few weeks - they all turned me down but said nothing but good things to me.

We're scaring men and boys by repeating these urban myths of a guy who talks to a woman and is arrested and sent to Guantanamo Bay.

I'm not saying injustices don't happen, but even when I actually am an asshole to women deliberately I've never suffered any consequences for it beyond my own shame.

I feel like this idea that you can't ask a woman out ever or strike up a conversation without being peper sprayed is out of control.","What is this thing about men not approaching women for dates at the risk of coming off like a ""creep""? Why are we normalizing this?"

AskMen,"I have been trying to get this out since a week or so after finding out about this pregnancy.  For some reason, even though I know what it is that I want to say, I can neither say it, nor type it.  You could say that every part of me has been trying to avoid talking about it.  I suppose I am scared.  Yep, that is it.  (Lightbulb moment) This is fear.  For multiple reasons, but we will get to that soon enough.
I thought that not talking about this pregnancy aloud was somehow better than dealing with the emotions that come with a conversation about it, with you. Because I already knew your sentiments regarding it without you saying anything. Before I thought about my feelings, for weeks, the only things that ran through my mind were what your thoughts could be.  Call me pessimistic, and please, correct me if I am wrong, but not one of them was positive.  And I think that with this amount of time passing, you are starting to resent me, and even be aggravated with me because you know what my sentiments are.  Which is the silent impasse we are at now.
Just so you know, it is not my intent to sway your feelings or to have you deal with my emotions. I do not believe that would be fair or helpful to you while you are dealing with your own.   I, on the other hand, have done quite the opposite already.  So, what I can say, is that I understand why you feel the way you feel, and have empathized with you, silently.  Placing myself in a situation like yours, regarding the loss of your son, I cannot say that I would not be thinking the same way.  That it is not fair, or “right.”  I will not include my speculation of what you meant when you said that “it is not right.”  Instead, in the spirit of optimism, I am going to assume that you meant that it is not right because you were speaking from a place that you feel your son would be speaking from, and not because of who I am, as a person.  With that being said, I get it, and because of that, if you choose, I will not flaunt/torture you with me carrying your baby.  I will not threaten you or hold anything over your head.  I will never make you feel bad, or less than the amazing man you are for your decisions.  To me, it has no bearing on the type of person you are, and you cannot help how you feel.  Please make sure you remember this.  Hopefully, knowing this will bring some relief from feeling pressured.  I never meant to make you feel that if you do or did.  I tried my best to do the opposite.  I do not hold any expectations or standards.  My decision is based on me and my feelings alone.
As you know, and have witnessed, I am not the type who does well with death, or loss.  I have experienced a lot of it over the past few 5 years, close to me, including the loss of my child.  (Not comparing) I hope you can understand why, without going into too much detail, I cannot give this child up.  I have had so much taken away; I cannot be the one to take something away from myself or this child.  I will not apologize for that, but only hope that you understand, or will one day.
Because I do not want to bother you with the details of me being pregnant, nor do I want you to assume you are obligated to take care of me, I keep it to myself.  Not to leave you out, I would be happy to update you, should you want that.
For the record, I think you would make a great father.  Not once did the thought cross my mind that you would not be.  I picture it sometimes and giggle.
 
In closing, and to keep it as short as possible before I get all emotional, here is the main takeaway:
I am fully aware that you did not ask for this, and I will not be forcing something on you in any way, shape, or form. Consent applies in many situations, and it is unfortunate that the rest of the world does not realize that.  I am prepared to lay in the bed I have made, and understanding the possible difficulties, I am still not worried.  I am happy.  I will go away if it would be easier for this situation.  I will be fine.
 
If you want to go through this with me, well that would be welcome.  I would be proud to take your opinions and input into consideration with every decision that comes with this pregnancy and baby.  Now and in the future, whatever our relationship be.  I think that I have proved for 17 years, I am not a vindictive co-parent and have a record of accomplishment of going out of my way to make sure the other parent gets to be a parent.  Unfortunately, at my own expense, however, it is a life lesson learned.  It has not changed the person that I am or how much I value my child making her own decisions regarding family, without my personal feelings involved.  I cannot stress that enough.  Oh, and just to let you know where I am at so far just in case you are curious:
The due date is 10/22/2023.  
I have a few ultrasound pictures in a book from 9 weeks (about 2 months) and there is for sure a baby in there.  It is a girl.  Too early to confirm, but I just know it.  The doctor says that everything is perfect so far and that he is happy with what he sees.  I go back on 4/12/2023 for bloodwork for diabetes testing and Rh factor testing.  After 13 weeks, there is less of a chance of miscarriage.
Also, I have tentatively picked out her first name.  It is Salila. Pronounced (Sah-lee-ah).  It means rain or water in one of the oldest languages in the world.  I have not gotten as far as her middle name yet, and I was waiting on you to decide what her last name will be.  
 
This is what I was so scared of.  This is all I wanted to get out in the open.  I hope this helps at least a little bit.","My friend recently made me feel like a worthless nobody. Out of nowhere.

AskMen,,do you have a female friend that you love more than your significant other?
AskMen,"Let me start out by saying I understand that this is more a ""me"" problem than a  ""we"" problem. I just need to get some diverse perspectives. My husband (32m) and I (29f) have been together for 8 years, married for 1. In that time, we have had very little conflict. He is a supportive husband and an amazing life partner. I trust him and love him dearly.

I have struggled with one thing throughout our entire relationship: his obsession with Instagram ""baddies"". He doesn't like, comment, or follow them. He searches for girls names and looks at them (for obvious reasons). I only know because his entire search feed and saves is filled with them. I don't actively go through his phone. But when I see them while he's scrolling, it makes me totally anxious.

 It makes me feel deep down, he isn't that attracted to me, and that hes hooked on this ""fantasy"" that I could never be. I really don't care about if he watches porn. And, our sex life is pretty great. There's just something so intrusive about seeking these girls out that makes me feel so low. 

Again, I know this is really more of a ""me"" problem than a ""him"" problem, but it still is a problem. I can't just make these feelings go away and I really don't know what to do.","My husband checks out models on insta, why does it make me feel so bad?"

AskMen,"I am 17 years old and I am approaching my six months anniversary with my girlfriend. I would like to do something sweet for her and came across the idea of a picnic. The day of our anniversary is on a Friday, and with her being on a tennis team and me being in work, I would have plan for something later on. The location I thought of for the picnic would be on a hill nearby an ice cream parlor, as well as a few other shops. With the picnic being much later in the day I was hoping for us to be able to watch the sun set and eventually gaze at the stars together while eating some of her favorite foods. The only issue is that the friday of our anniversary is scheduled to rain.

I am now struggling to come up with other date ideas that I consider fairly sweet and somewhat romantic, as my previous idea was and I would hate to have to settle for less. My possibilities are also fairly limited as I recently obtained a liscense and cannot legally drive her for another 4 months, although my parents (with much persuasion) have okayed me driving her this one time. I of course would have to check with her parents to make sure they too are ok with me driving her, but I am not worried as they have let many of her freinds drive her before they legally could either.

AskMen,"I (28f) went on a few dates with this dude (32m). We shared a lot in common, and I was enjoying our time together considering our shared interests and banter. But it kinda felt like I was hitting a wall with him at a certain point. It seemed like there was only so much connection he’d allow.

He was sort of formal and didn’t provide “words of affirmation”. He actually stopped himself from complimenting me once (mid compliment), which was super weird. The compliment seemed to come intuitively but he immediately stopped himself when he became conscious of what he was doing. It didn’t take long for me to question if he was emotionally available. 

I called it out on it cause that sort of behavior is not conducive to building a connection (or seeing if there’s something there), and asked if he wasn’t interested or if something else was going on. 

He apologized, assured me that he thinks there’s chemistry, complimented me, said he thinks there’s potentially something between us and said he’d like to continue to explore it. 

Fast forward to our last date. I felt the most connected to him. And he seemed to feel connected to me, too. All seemed well. He gave me this romantic kiss before he left. I was certain we’d see each other again.

However, as we were mid planning our 6th date (all seemed normal).. he (quite abruptly) ended things. He said he didn’t think we could sustain a long term relationship, told me I didn’t even have to respond, and ended things with “I hope you find what you’re looking for.” I wished him the best and that was that.

I’m quite confused because we seemed to be developing an attachment/connection. Like….. what.

Any insight as to what potentially happened here?

my man love golf. 

I’ve been playing with me dad but not too good at it, love the driving range but haven’t really properly enjoy playing on a course yet.

I speak mandarin/Chinese with my dad and golf coach so my vocab book for golf terms/slangs aren’t too fancy other than the basics. however I’ve been watching the majors and the tour recently and have picked up a few.

the other day when I joined my boyfriend when he hit the club (sometimes I like to go with him, I like watching him play or when he teach me how to read the green and such) couple of words/sentences slipped through my tongue like gimme or hitting it off the toe babe! and such

funny that I see surprise in his eyes (good surprise) and his face just light up as a golden retriever, he said I made him proud lol then we have another workout session when we got back home cuz he said that proper turn him on too.

Afterwards, I messaged him saying I had fun and to let me know if he wanted to get together again when he's in NYC. He responded with ""for sure, hopefully in the next month or two."" Fast forward to last week and he was in town for 4 days. We Zoom on a weekly basis so I knew he had booked the trip and was going to be here. I was waiting for him to plan something with me but he never said anything so I brought up doing something 1-1 again like going to dinner. He said that he wanted to keep his evenings open to hang out with old college buddies that live in town. I told him that I thought we were going to do something at some point while he was here since he had told me multiple times he would keep me posted on plans when I asked.

We met up in the office one day and he asked me if I wanted to talk so we went into a conference room. He told me that he likes to keep his professional and personal lives separate. The dinner we had in Boston was a one-time thing because he knew I would only be there for a short 24 hours. He said he likes working with me and enjoys my company. He was worried about coming across as callous. I told him he had kept saying he'd keep me posted and he responded that he should have been more clear. I told him okay because I didn't know what else to say and then we left the room. Afterwards, we ended up running out to grab lunch together because it was a little tense. He also messaged me the next day about a happy hour that was happening so I went to it. Again, it was a little awkward given the conversation he had with me.
