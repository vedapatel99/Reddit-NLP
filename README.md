## Problem Statement

The subreddits r/AskWomen and r/AskMen serve as online communities for people to share their experiences, questions and opinions on a vast array of topics reguarding relationships, gender issues, even service or product recommendations, plus so much more. As a social experiment, I set out to build an NLP model that can analyze and compare the language used by users posting in the AskWomen and AskMen subreddits. I wanted my model to be able to distinguish any gener-based differences based on questions asked, topics discussed, etc. With this language analysis, we can try to get insight on how gender might affect social interactions, specifically online. My hope is for this NLP model to serve as a tool for researchers and everyday people who are interesting in how language might affect social identities.
